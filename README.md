# Snake
Snake is a game where you control a snake and try to eat as many dots as you can. Be careful, though, because each dot increases the length of your tail, and if you run into your tail, it's game over.

Swipe in any direction to control where your worm will go.

Going off the edge of the screen will loop you back to the other side.
